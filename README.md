# 🧩C++ Console Projects
<br>
Author:Jatan kumar

This repository contains a collection of **C++ console-based projects** built while learning and practicing C++.  
The projects progress from **beginner to advanced** level, covering core concepts like:

- 📘 Basics: loops, arrays, strings, functions  
- 🏗️ Intermediate: OOP (classes, inheritance, polymorphism), STL, recursion, file handling  
- 🚀 Advanced: algorithms, design patterns, DSA-based applications  

All projects run in the **console (terminal/command prompt)** using standard C++ (cin, cout, file I/O) without GUI libraries.
